Okay kid, the fastest way to get an internship with KFit Product and Engineering team is to build something. Forget whatever they teach you about resume. Show us what you've built over the weekend. Remember that one time you did a neat hack and almost got into trouble? Tell us that story.

I heard you do freelance gigs? Then show it to me. Remember that one time where you sneaked into that Intro to Programming test? Just so you can help your struggling non-techie friends? Or the semester where they banned you from the hostel? Because they don't know how to stop you from running freely on their network?

I want to hear all about it. Tell it with pride, kid. And throw your resume away.
